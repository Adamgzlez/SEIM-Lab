# SIEM LAB

## Objective

The SIEM Lab was to establish an environment to understand Splunk using its searching capabilities, uploading files, and customizing reports and alerts for each given task to help mitigate future attacks. The focus was to analyze logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, analyzing file data that imitated real-world attack scenarios. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of Splunk as well as custom alerts, reports, and using Splunks search engine to analyze data.

### Skills Learned

- Basic understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Using fields to analyze and interpret network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns with reports.
- Enhanced knowledge of security vulnerabilities.
- Developing baselines and centering alerts around them. 

### Tools Used

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis. (SPLUNK)
- Custom Reports and Alerts
- Splunk searching
- Uploading files
- Using fields

## Steps

1. Finding the DDOS attack and how long did it take to recover report.

2. Uploading Nessus reports for and using that data to build an alert and report.

3. Uploading admin login attempts and finding when the brute force occured and developing a baseline for a new alert.
